cotorsion_localization
======================

A generalization of torsion theory that generalizes torsion methodologies for abelian groups. This is useful for constructing a filtration on the abelian category of homotopy invariant sheaves with transfers (HI). This is more or less a mirror of "Menage Ã  Trois", with proofs redone to fit the language of abelian categories. The results there are also extended to include their duals.

This is tied together by the section titled "Filtration" where the examples of HI are discussed in greater depth.
